## Import direction

Within each feature, layers follow the same direction:

```
features/<x>/presentation/  ──►  features/<x>/domain/  ◄──  features/<x>/data/
        │                              │
        └────────────►  core/  ◄───────┘
```

| Layer                              | Allowed imports                                                              |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `features/<x>/presentation/`       | `features/<x>/domain/`, `core/`                                              |
| `features/<x>/domain/`             | `core/` **only** (never other features, never `data/`)                     |
| `features/<x>/data/`               | `features/<x>/domain/`, `core/`                                              |
| `core/`                            | Other `core/` submodules — **except** `core/network/dio_client.dart`, which is allowed to import `features/auth/domain/` |

## Why this matters

- The domain layer is the business-core; it must not depend on Flutter or Dio.
- The data layer can change (new endpoints, new caches) without touching the domain or presentation.
- The presentation layer can be rebuilt (e.g. for a web target) without changing business rules.

## What "domain may import core" really means

The domain layer is allowed to use shared utilities — `Either`, `Failure`, primitives — but **not** the concrete `Dio` instance or any `flutter_secure_storage`. If you find yourself wanting to import `core/network/` from `domain/`, you have a layering bug.

## The one exception

`core/network/dio_client.dart` (and the `AuthInterceptor`) is allowed to import `features/auth/domain/` because the interceptor needs the auth domain types to perform refresh. **This file is code-owner gated** — see [code-ownership.md](./code-ownership.md).

## Tests

Test files follow the same rules and mirror the feature layout:
`test/features/<feature>/{domain,data,presentation}/`.
Cross-cutting test helpers in `test/helpers/` may be imported anywhere.
